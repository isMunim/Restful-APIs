# APIs
###Some APIs I made while learning how to make APIs with Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy

This code base is just a collection of APIs I made while learning RESTful API development.

##API Keys for third party providers
Will beed Goole Maps and foursquare API keys to make some of the APIs work.


##Python Libraries
The code in this repository assumes the following python libraries are installed:
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* httplib
* requests
* oauth2client
* redis
* passlib
* itsdangerous
* flask-httpauth

##Installing Redis

      cd redis-stable
      make install
